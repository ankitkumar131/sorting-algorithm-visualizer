# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This Python GUI application provides a visual demonstration of various sorting algorithms. It allows users to generate random arrays and visualize how different sorting algorithms rearrange the elements to sort the array.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using tkinter.
- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Supports multiple sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Heap Sort
- Adjustable sorting speed.
- Generates random arrays for sorting.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- matplotlib
- numpy
